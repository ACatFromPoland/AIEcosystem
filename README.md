# AIEcosystem

The Final Code and Project are in Version 3.10 GUI

This is my 2-3 week project for my Computer Science Subject. I decided to try attempt to make a Ecosystem with some very Simple Ai.
It went quite well. My code is very bad don't expect anything amazing. It mainly uses simple concepts like Classes, a 2DArray, a Game loop, a simple Gui and PyGal to print the chart.

The `WalkTo` and `Generate(Rabbit/Fox)` Functions inside of the Animal Class need to be cleaned up heavily.
